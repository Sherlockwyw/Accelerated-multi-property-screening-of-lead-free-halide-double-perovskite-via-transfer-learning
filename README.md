code and dataset
1. The core code implements nearly all functionalities. Readers need to modify the file paths to run the code.  

2. Original_data.xlsx contains formation energy, Ehull, bandgap, B, G, and 132 Magpie-generated features.  

3. df_predictSet.xlsx represents the compositional space of lead-free halide double perovskites, including chemical compositions and Magpie features for screening.
